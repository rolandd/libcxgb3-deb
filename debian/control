Description: Userspace driver for Chelsio T3-based iWARP adapters
 libcxgb3 is a device-specific driver for Chelsio T3-based iWARP (RDMA
 over IP/ethernet) adapters for the libibverbs library.  This allows
 userspace processes to access Chelsio iWARP hardware directly with
 low latency and low overhead.
 .
 This package contains the loadable plug-in.
